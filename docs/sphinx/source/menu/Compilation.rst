Compilation
===========

The compilation of the SofaPython3 can be done automatically when `building SOFA <https://www.sofa-framework.org/community/doc/getting-started/build/linux/>`__,
or it can be done independently using an already compiled/installed SOFA. The former is called an *in-tree build*, which is,
the compilation of SofaPython3 is included inside the build tree of SOFA. The latter is called an *out-of-tree build*, hence
the compilation of SofaPython3 is done in its own build tree, usually placed somewhere else than SOFA. This page will
cover both methods.

Prerequisites
-------------
The compilation of SofaPython3 requires the installation of some dependencies. The following table lists all of those
prerequisites.

        .. warning::

            Add the installation path of each of those dependencies into your environment variable. For example,
            using the PowerShell of Windows:

            .. code-block:: powershell

                PS $env:Path += ";C:\sofa;C:\pybind11;C:\python"

In-tree build
-------------

We use here the term *in-tree build* to indicate that we wish to compile SofaPython3 in the same build tree as SOFA, which is,
compiling SOFA will automatically compile SofaPython3 as an internal subproject. In this case, the compilation of the
plugin should be straightforward, given that you installed correctly all the dependencies of SofaPython3.

Follow the same steps as the one needed to compile SOFA : `<https://www.sofa-framework.org/community/doc/getting-started/build/linux>`__.
When you get to the step **Generate a Makefile with CMake**, activate the CMake option **SOFA_FETCH_SOFAPYTHON3**:

.. figure:: /images/cmake_fetch_sp3.jpg
    :alt: Activate the cmake option SOFA_FETCH_SOFAPYTHON3
    :align: center

and configure CMake. This will pull the source code of SofaPython3 into the `application/plugins` directory of SOFA's
source directory.

.. note::

    The CMake option **SOFA_FETCH_SOFAPYTHON3** should disable itself automatically once CMake has been configure one
    time. This is to prevent pulling again the SofaPython3 source code again the next time you run cmake. If you need
    to update the plugin, you can manually turn the option `ON` again to pull the latest changes made in SofaPython3.

Once cmake has pulled the source code of SofaPython3 into the `application/plugins` directory, a new CMake option should
now be available : **PLUGIN_SOFAPYTHON3**. Make sure you activate it and re-run CMake configure and generate:

.. figure:: /images/cmake_activate_sp3.jpg
    :alt: Activate the cmake option PLUGIN_SOFAPYTHON3
    :align: center

If everything went fine during the cmake configuration stage, you should be able to find some information on the version
of python and pybind11 used for the compilation of the plugin:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cmake ..
    (...)
    Adding plugin SofaPython3
    -- Python:
        Version: 3.9.1
        Executable: /usr/bin/python3.9
        Headers: /usr/include/python3.9
        Libraries: /usr/lib64/libpython3.9.so
        User site: /home/jnbrunet/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages
    -- pybind11:
        Version: 2.6.1
        Config: /usr/share/cmake/pybind11/pybind11Config.cmake
    (...)
    -- Configuring done
    -- Generating done
    -- Build files have been written to: /home/jnbrunet/sources/sofa/build

At this point, you are ready to start the compilation of SOFA and the SofaPython3 plugin.

Out-of-tree build
-----------------

If you want to compile the SofaPython3 plugin out-of-tree, you will need to either:

* [**Method 1**] Install the `SOFA binaries and headers <https://www.sofa-framework.org/download/>`__
  somewhere on your computer and note its installation directory. Or,
* [**Method 2**] Compile it following the `SOFA build documentation <https://www.sofa-framework.org/community/doc/getting-started/build/linux/>`__.
  Once it is built, execute the installation by going into the build directory of SOFA (for example,
  */home/user/sofa/build/master/*), and using the command ``cmake --install .``

.. warning::

    If you choose the first method (installing the binaries), make sure you have all the SOFA dependencies installed on
    your system (e.g. boost, Eigen3, etc.). You can follow the same instructions as if you had chosen the second method
    (compiling SOFA), but skipping the compilation part.

Once done, export the installation path of SOFA inside the ``SOFA_ROOT`` environment variable. For example,

.. code-block:: bash

    $ export SOFA_ROOT="/home/user/sofa/build/master/install"


.. note::

   To make sure your ``SOFA_ROOT`` is well defined, you can verify that the following file path exists:

   .. code-block:: bash

        $SOFA_ROOT/lib/cmake/SofaFramework/SofaFrameworkTargets.cmake

We are now ready to compile SofaPython3. Let's first create three new environment variables: **SP3_SRC**, **SP3_BUILD**
and **SP3_ROOT** that will be use to set the location to the source code, the built files and the installed files,
respectively. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ export SP3_SRC=/opt/SofaPython3/src
    $ export SP3_BUILD=/opt/SofaPython3/build
    $ export SP3_ROOT=/opt/SofaPython3/build/install

Let's now pull the source code of the plugin, configure the build and start the compilation and installation.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/sofa-framework/SofaPython3.git $SP3_SRC
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$SOFA_ROOT/lib/cmake \
            -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
            -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$SP3_ROOT\
            -S $SP3_SRC \
            -B $SP3_BUILD
    $ cmake --build $SP3_BUILD
    $ cmake --install $SP3_BUILD

That's it, you are now ready to use SofaPython3. Keep the environment variable **SOFA_ROOT** and **SP3_ROOT** close by
for the upcoming sections.
