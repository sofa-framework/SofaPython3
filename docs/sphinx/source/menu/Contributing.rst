Pull requests
-------------

If you are able to patch a bug, add the feature yourself, add new examples or simply fix a typo – fantastic, make a pull request with the code! Be sure you have read any documents on contributing and you understand `the SOFA license <https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/blob/master/LICENCE.txt>`_. Once you have submitted a pull request the maintainer(s) can compare your branch to the existing one and decide whether or not to incorporate (pull in) your changes.

*Reminder - How to pull request*

* `Fork <http://guides.github.com/activities/forking/>`_ the repository and clone it locally.
* `Connect your clone <https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/>`_ to the `original upstream repository <https://github.com/sofa-framework/SofaPython3/>`_ by adding it as a remote.
* Create a branch for your changes.
* Make your changes.
* Pull in changes from upstream often to `synchronize your fork <https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/>`_ so that merge conflicts will be less likely in your pull request.
* `Create a pull request <https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/>`_ when you are ready to propose your changes into the main project.
