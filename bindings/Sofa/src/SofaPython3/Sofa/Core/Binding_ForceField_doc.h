Assemble the stiffness matrix of a force field.

Note that this function is not free. It assembles the stiffness matrix whether or not it has been assembled previously
to add it into the global system matrix. Besides, the function does not prevent side effects of a second matrix assembly
in a single time step.

Typical usage example:
FEM = root.addObject('HexahedronFEMForceField', name="FEM", youngModulus="4000", poissonRatio="0.3", method="large")
...
stiffness_matrix = self.force_field.assembleKMatrix()

Returns:
    A scipy.sparse.csr_matrix object representing the stiffness matrix of the force field
)";
