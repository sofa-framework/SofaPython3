        Base class for components which can be added in a simulation

        An object defines a part of the functionnality in the simulation
        (stores state data, specify topology, compute forces, etc).
        Each simulation object is related to a context, which gives access to all available external data.
        It is able to process events, if listening enabled (default is false).

        Example of use:
        .. code-block:: python

            import Sofa.Core
            import SofaRuntime
            SofaRuntime.importPlugin("SofaComponentAll")

            root.addObject("MechanicalObject", name="obj") # Add a common Sofa object
            root.obj # Access the object
            root.obj.name # Access the name of the object
